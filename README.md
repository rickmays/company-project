# Company Project
## Summary
This web page is an update to an existing business website in a nearby community - Strutty's Feed & Pet Supply. I completed this "Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox" as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer bootcamp. Strutty's original web site is at: http://www.struttys.com/Home, which is a multi-page site. I opted to make this a one page web site with links to the types of products they sell in order to keep the scope reasonable for this project.
## The Experience
- I used three Google fonts in the project: Dancing Script and Recursive for headers and Merriweather for regular text.
- For the company's product-types, I used flexbox to create alternating left-side and right-side images and text in the desktop and tablet views, which dropped to a single column in mobile view. I used flexbox in nearly all parts of the site to ensure responsive behavior on various device sizes. I found there were natural breakpoints at widths of 799px and 699px so I created media queries to take advantage of those.
- I was very pleasantly surprised at how little code was required in CSS media queries to get the site to size and flow appropriately in tablet and mobile screen sizes.
- I used several images from Unsplash and created a Image Attributions section at the bottom of the page to credit the creators of the images I used. The rest of the images are from various vendors of farm products web sites. Here's what I did for image attributions:
    - Created links to where the Unsplash photos were being used on the page
    - Used a title attribute in the images (or div in the case of the header background image) to show the image attribution information when the mouse hovers over the image
    - In the image attributions section, I linked to the creator's page on Unsplash and the page showing the search I did to find the image
